The Box2D library is easy to build. I recommend adding the source files in the Box2D folder into your build system or project files for your IDE. The Box2D library is portable, so you should not need to configure it for your platform.

Building the testbed is optional and may not work on your platform. I use premake5 to generate projects for the testbed. You can get premake5 here: https://premake.github.io/

I support premake working well for Visual Studio on Windows 10 and Xcode on on MacOS. I appreciate contributions to get premake working on other platforms.

Here are the steps for Visual Studio 2017:
- Command line: premake5 vs2017
- Open the resulting Box2D.sln (should be in Build/vs2017)
- Set Testbed as the startup project
- In the Testbed debugging properties, set the Working Directory to ..\..\Testbed
- Press F5 to build and run the Testbed

Here are the steps for Xcode:
- Command line: premake5 xcode4
- Open the resulting project file (should be Build/xcode4)
- Set the Testbed as the current Scheme
- Edit the Testbed Scheme, in the Run Options, use a custom working directory
- Set the Testbed directory as the working directory
- Press Command-R to build and run the Testbed

Thanks,
